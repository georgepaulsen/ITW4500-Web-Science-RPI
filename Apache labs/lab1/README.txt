This lab was a good review of a lot of front-end development. I am still not fantastic
at Javascript but I learn more every time I grapple with it. My initial plan was to
have two columns, one would transition through the tweets, and the other would house the
user's favorite tweets. The little pulsing heart was going to be clickable and would
generate the likes column. I learned that when I generated the cards through JS that I
would not be able to select the tweet (or at least I do not know how to) so I was forced
to come up with some other creative idea. I decided to keep track of the most popular tweets.
When I new tweet appears on the screen it is checked against the current highest rank tweet
and if it surpasses the tweet in likes it goes to the top of the board.

Another area I struggled with was using bootstrap. I have never really properly used bootstrap
before and I initially was going to avoid it, but I decided to take the time to fool around
with it and tried to incorporate it so that a mobile version looked presentable.

I also had a lot of trouble with the json file, it was broken in some areas and it took me
way too long to clean it up.

Once I got bootstrap under my fingers a little I had some fun testing some styles and it did
speed the process of formatting up for the mobile version.

After the file was cleaned up I had a relatively easy time picking through the json file
to get the information I wanted.

Although I was not able to make the favorite tweets column I was still happy with what I
created.
