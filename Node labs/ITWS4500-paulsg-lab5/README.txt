Lab 5 Mongo Madness

INSTRUCTIONS
Pretty straight forward, npm install the packages, then type in a query you want to populate
the db with. Next hit read DB to display it on the web page, then you can export it, and
the reset button drops the data in the database. If you hit search without entering a
query it has a default value. Likewise, if you do not select a filetype, the default is
json. I used a local database for storage.

EXPERIENCE / HARD STUFF
This lab took a while to pull off because I was very shaky with mongo and the npm package
had a lot of documentation, but a lot of it was outdated. Then I discovered Mongoose.
Mongoose helped me streamline the process with easier documentation and more stack overflow
issues I could refer to. Writing out to the files took the longest because I was being dumb
and did not think to just write it out to a file I kept looking for some crazy mongoose
function with no success.

EASY STUFF / CONCLUSION
After struggling through this for the week I feel like I understand the basics of mongo
and how to implement it with node. I am really getting used to express and angular for
communication throughout the app which makes testing features and handling error that come
up a lot easier. Overall I am happy with this lab and am excited to continue to build this
dark blue with lime green and electric blue highlights for the remainder of the semester.
