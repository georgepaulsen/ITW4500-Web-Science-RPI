now travel to the visualize page for the lab 7 content

VISUALIZATIONS
Per the directions I made three visualizations:
1. A bar graph comparing the query to the number of results
   this shows how "trending" a topic is as the results are only from that day
   from the data that I put in, you can see that sports and corona are very popular topics
   but "tuition refunds" are not so much!

2. A doughnut graph showing the distribution of sources
   The theme here is where does your news come from? This graph shows how a few news outlets
   are extra popular
   
3. Another doughnut graph showing the number of authors who have written 1 article vs the
   number of authors who have written multiple articles
   Again the idea here is to show that a lot of authors are writing multiple articles.
   News should be unbiased, but if it is the same author then biases may arise

EXPERIENCE / HARD STUFF
chart.js was a friggin nightmare to get working. The documentation on their core page is
absolute garbage it has no angular integration. So it was hell until I found a better
documentation from GitHub. Configuring the data was also hard because I had to do a lot
of parsing and manipulation to get interesting results.

EASY STUFF / CONCLUSION
Once I figured out how to use chart.js and realized there are defaults that I do not need to
hardcode like widths and colors I was able to test different graphs easier.

Overall I liked creating the visualizations towards the end of Friday when I finally figured
it out!
